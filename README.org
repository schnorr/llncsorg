The LNCS in OrgMode, just type make. The ORG file is
named =llncs= (with two "l"s, and not one) because the Latex class is
llncs, and not lncs as one would expect. But anyways, just type make.

Be aware that this example is compatible with OrgMode 9.*. Earlier
or later OrgMode versions may require minor modifications to the Makefile
and/or llncs.org files.

For a detailed explanation on why and how to write reproducible
articles using OrgMode, please visit the following [[https://github.com/alegrand/RR_webinars/blob/master/1_replicable_article_laboratory_notebook/index.org][page]].
